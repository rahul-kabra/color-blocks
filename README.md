# Color Blocks - A fun quiz where popular cartoon, characters, tv shows and movies are depicted in the form of color blocks 🎨

All of the iconic, popular and memorable characters have had something unique about them which distinguishes them from the rest, makes them different and helps us in remembering them by that particular trait.

` ✨ Colors ✨ `

Their representation via a single color or multi color pattern is what we very distinctly remember about them and that in turn makes them quickly identifiable. 🌈

This is a fun project where some of the most well-known characters in video games, cartoons, tv shows and movies have been portrayed in the form of color blocks. 😊 

So get going and see how well do you know these characters solely by their color representation. 🎯

To make it a little bit simpler, we have also provided clues as part of every question. 💡
